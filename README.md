# FinalProject
http://cvlab.hanyang.ac.kr/tracker_benchmark/datasets.html datasets used for implementing this project
Our contributions with this paper are the benchmarks done on OpenCV object tracking algorithms (CSRT, TLD, MIL, MOSSE, Medianflow, Boosting, KCF). Benchmark is done on the OTB-100 dataset.we have used  harcascade method to implement this
